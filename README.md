# IBIM's Error Analysis (Experiments)

This repository provides numerical experiments for "Error Analysis of Implicit Boundary Integral Method".

Experiments include:

- [x] 2D experiments on circle
- [x] 3D experiments on sphere
- [x] 2D experiments on segment
- [x] 2D experiments on capsule shape
- [x] 2D experiments on semi-circle
- [x] 2D experiments on convex curve with vanishing curvatures
- [ ] 3D experiments on molecule surface 

Codes are tested on MATLAB (2023a).
